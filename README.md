Browser extensions are an important component in our work environment as they help us solve specific problems related to working with browsers, or improve the quality of our work. In this paper, I propose to explore how we can enhance Google Chrome extensions by using the Vue.js framework together with the TypeScript language. Vue.js is a modern framework for building web interfaces and is increasingly being used in web application development. The TypeScript language adds types to JavaScript and helps reduce code errors. We will explore how we can use these two technologies to develop an extension for our browser that will be scalable and easier to maintain.

Objectives:
The primary objectives of this study are as follows:

To design and develop a browser extension using Vue.js framework and TypeScript language.
To evaluate the effectiveness of these technologies in creating a high-quality and user-friendly browser extension.
To compare the performance and functionality of the developed browser extension with existing similar extensions.
To demonstrate the potential of Vue.js and TypeScript in creating scalable and maintainable browser extensions.
To contribute to the existing body of knowledge on browser extension development, particularly with respect to the use of Vue.js and TypeScript.

Actuality:
The development of browser extensions has gained significant importance in recent years, as users increasingly rely on them to improve their browsing experience and productivity. With millions of people using Chromium-based browsers such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Opera, the need for high-quality and user-friendly extensions has become more pressing than ever. While there are numerous frameworks and programming languages available for extension development, Vue.js and TypeScript have emerged as popular choices among developers due to their simplicity, flexibility, and performance. Thus, exploring the potential of these technologies in building a browser extension is highly relevant and timely. Additionally, this study aims to contribute to the existing body of knowledge on browser extension development, particularly with respect to the use of Vue.js and TypeScript.
